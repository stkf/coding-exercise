# Cynnovative Coding Exercise

Fork this repository, answer the questions in whichever form you want (e.g. `.txt`, add new `README.md` files, etc.), build your Dockerized programs in the language of your choice, then submit a pull request with your code.

## Question 1 - How big is this file?

The following screenshot is of a file opened in a text editor, with MIME  type `text/plain`, and is seemingly small. What is the file's size in `bytes`?

## Question 2 - Python and Switch Statements

The programming language Python does not have a `switch` construct. What is a way of recreating a `switch` statement in Python? Write an example that will use the following list of values as cases and actions:

```
Value: 'red', Action: paintItRed()
Value: 'green', Action: paintItGreen()
Value: 'blue', Action: paintItBlue()
Value: 'default', Action: paintIt()
```

## Question 3 - StackOverflow and Java

The most copied Java code snippet in StackOverflow has a bug in it:

```
private static String[] prefix = new String[] {"","K","M","G","T","P","E"};

public static String humanByteCount(long bytes, boolean si) {
    if (bytes == 0) return "0 B";
    int unit = si ? 1000 : 1024;
    double power = Math.min(Math.floor(Math.log(bytes)/Math.log(unit)), 6);
    String pref = prefix[(int) power] + (si && power > 0 ? "iB" : "B");
    String format = power == 0 ? "%.0f %s" : "%.1f %s";
    return String.format(format, bytes / Math.pow(unit, power), pref);
}
```

Can you find the bug?

## Question 4 - Binary File Analysis

Binary file analysis take variou forms. Write a Dockerized program, in the language of your choice, that finds all the printable `strings` in an input binary file and prints them out to `stdout`.

Example of desired functionality:

```
$ docker build -t $YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE Dockerfile
$ docker run -it $YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE find_strings /bin/ls
$ Corresponding Output:

## Question 5 - Circular Prime Numbers

A very interesting mathematical concept is that of circular prime numbers. A circular prime number is a prime number `p` that, when rearraging its digits, all the possible combinations are also prime.

For example, the number `13` is a circular prime because `13` and `31` are primes.

Create a Dockerized program, in the language of your choice, that finds all the circular prime numbers below `500000`.

Example of desired functionality:

```
$ docker build -t $YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE Dockerfile
$ docker run -it $YOUR_DOCKER_IMAGE circular_primes
$ Corresponding Output:
  2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, ...
```
